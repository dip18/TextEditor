# TextEditor 1.0

It is a GUI based text editor application. I have implemented all the basic functions of an editor. A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software.It can be used to change configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code. Some of the text editor's features will be updated on the later versions, such as Find Text, Replace All and Highlighting the current line etc. As of now it is an useful application for the text editing.
